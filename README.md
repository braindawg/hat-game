# hat-game
A multiplayer implementation of the Hat Game (aka Fishbowl Game).

## Game rules:
Two teams play 3 rounds of the game, with each round having different rules. At the end of 3 rounds, the team with the most points wins.

### Preparation:
After each team member logs into the game lobby, they can choose to be on one team or the other. When the teams are balanced, the game can be started.

Each player will be prompted three times to enter sets of words on their personal device. The first time they will enter one word, the second time they will be prompted for two words, and the third prompt will require three words. The words need not be related to each other in any way, even within a set (e.g. the words "trombone rainstorm" would still make a valid two-word set despite being nonsensical as a pair).

Once all words are entered, gameplay begins with a randomly-assigned first player.

### Gameplay each round:
Each player will be shown a set of words and given 60 seconds to give clues to their team to get them to guess each of the words in the set. If they succeed, that team scores a point, that set of words is removed from the game for the rest of the round, and the player can give clues for the next set of words they are given. There is no limit to the number of sets a team can score during a player's 60-second round, but *all words in a set* must be guessed in order for the team to score the point. If a team fails to guess all words from a set before time expires, that set is put back into the available pool. Play alternates between members of the two teams. A round ends when all available sets have been guessed ("removed from the bowl").

#### Round 1:
The clues given in Round 1 must be verbal clues, using as many words as needed, but without saying any of the words on the card and without rhyming. It's basically Catchphrase rules.

#### Round 2:
Round 2 is the "Charades" round: no words or sounds may be uttered, and physical action is the only clue allowed. The use of props or pointing to things in the room is a house rule - I don't like it, but plenty of people do, so that should be discussed before the game starts to reach a consensus. (I will say that it is **very** hard to get someone to guess "pink" without being able to point.)

#### Round 3:
Round 3 is the memory round, almost always the hardest round of the game. For each set of words presented to the clue giver, they are allowed to utter *only one word* as a clue to their team. For example, if the set were "purple monkey dishwasher", the clue might be "gorilla".

The team must be able to connect that clue word to one of the set words, then remember which other words complete that set. If the team cannot guess the complete set, no additional clues may be given - the clue giver just has to sit there and sweat until time ends. It is not unusual for many turns in round 3 to fail to score, but each player that fails to score has now spent 60 seconds staring at that set, so they are much more likely to get it if a teammate then gives a clue for it.

### Scoring:
After each round of gameplay, the sets are counted and each team receives 1 point per set that they guessed correctly. When the game ends, these per-round scores are summed, and the team with the highest score wins!
